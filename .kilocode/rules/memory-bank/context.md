# Active Context: Liquor Club Management System

## Current State

**Application Status**: ✅ Full implementation with MongoDB + Authentication + API + M-Pesa

A complete Liquor Club Management System with 11 functional pages, MongoDB database, JWT authentication, and M-Pesa integration.

## Recently Completed

- [x] **Dynamic categories in AddProductModal**: Category dropdown now fetches active categories from the database via `/api/categories`; new categories can be added inline via POST to API
- [x] **Product grid removal**: Completely removed products grid from POS; interface now consists of header, customer selector, search dropdown, category filters, and order cart that fills remaining viewport
- [x] **Cart table format**: Reordered cart item display into single-row table layout with columns: Item Name (col-span-4), Unit selector (col-span-2), Unit Price (col-span-2, right-aligned), Quantity controls (col-span-2, centered), Line Total Amount (col-span-1, right-aligned), and Delete button (col-span-1)
- [x] **Sale product highlighting**: Products on Happy Hour (Shot category) display with amber border/background, bold font, increased font size (+2pt), and "✨ Happy Hour" badge
- [x] **VAT-inclusive tax calculation**: Changed tax computation to extract VAT from gross (inclusive) prices using formula: Tax = Gross − (Gross ÷ 1.16); subtotal now stores net amount, total stores gross amount
- [x] **POS layout optimization**: Redesigned POS to maximize vertical space using ultra-compact horizontal layout (xs fonts, tight spacing, minimal padding), consolidated header into single row, and compact customer/order controls
- [x] Bright/Dark theme toggle with persistence and premium design
- [x] Fixed light theme by adding CSS variable overrides for `[data-theme="bright"]` in globals.css
- [x] POS/Billing page with touch-friendly interface, happy hour, split bills, tabs
- [x] Enhanced Inventory with real-time stock tracking, batch tracking, reorder alerts
- [x] Bar/Drink Management with recipes, happy hour scheduling
- [x] Customer/Membership Management with loyalty tiers, credit tracking
- [x] Staff/User Management with roles, shifts, commission tracking
- [x] Reports/Analytics with sales charts, staff performance
- [x] Financial Management with income/expense tracking, P&L
- [x] Supplier Management with purchase orders, credit
- [x] Compliance/Regulatory with KRA excise, licenses, audit trails
- [x] Alerts & Notifications system
- [x] Settings page with POS, tax, business configuration
- [x] MongoDB database with Mongoose ODM
- [x] Seed script with sample data
- [x] AddProductModal - comprehensive multi-section form with validation, organized into Basic Info, Product Details, Pricing, Compliance, and Additional sections
- [x] Fixed corrupted inventory/page.tsx by removing duplicate code and separating modal components
- [x] Created standalone AddProductModal.tsx component with AddProductModal and EditProductModal exports
- [x] **Authentication System**: JWT-based auth with login/logout/refresh, User model with roles, protected middleware, AuthContext
- [x] **Real Backend API Routes**: Comprehensive REST API for all modules (Staff, Orders, Recipes, HappyHours, Licenses, Transactions, etc.)
- [x] **M-Pesa Integration**: STK Push with full callback handling, transaction tracking, environment config
- [x] **Category Manager**: Full CRUD for product categories with color picker, icon emoji, sort ordering, active flag, and dedicated UI page
- [x] **Favicon Update**: Updated favicon to use GlassWater icon from sidebar navigation, added SVG favicon to public directory
- [x] **Unit Selection in Shopping Cart**: Dynamic unit conversion dropdown (kg, g, lbs, oz, pieces, packs, sets) with real-time price/total updates, persisted throughout checkout process; includes database schema updates (OrderItem with unit, conversionFactor, unitPrice) and API integration with ProductUOM model
- [x] **Fixed unit price calculation**: Prices now correctly calculated based on base product price and unit conversion factor, eliminating rounding errors when switching between units
- [x] **Product persistence**: AddProductModal now saves products to database via `/api/products` POST (create) and PATCH (update); inventory page refetches after success; added PATCH/DELETE endpoints to products API; transformed API response to frontend format
- [x] **Inventory data loading**: Inventory page now loads products from database on mount, eliminating hardcoded data and ensuring proper MongoDB ObjectId handling for edit operations
- [x] **Alternate unit pricing**: Fixed data persistence for alternate unit sellPrice and costPrice; added fields to Unit schema; updated API to store and return these values; POS now uses stored unit prices for cart calculations, falling back to computed when not set
- [x] **POS cart refactor**: Removed algorithmic price derivation; all unit selections now use predefined fixed sellPrice from product configuration; unit price computation simplified to direct lookup
